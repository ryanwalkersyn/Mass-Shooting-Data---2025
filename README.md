# Mass-Shooting-Data---2025
Data Analysis on Mass Shooting Data

## Description
This is a working repository for my Data Cleaning and Data Analysis methods while working with Mass Shooter Data. I am still learning the ins and outs of github, so I expect this repository to be messy while I'm learning, but for portfolio purposes wanted to make my methods and scripts public.

## Data Sources
Currently the source of the data used is [Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/)' gun data database. This database was chosen primarily for its ease of use. Mother Jones uses an incredibly restrictive definition of mass shooting and removes data from gang shootings making it an appropriate source for the analysis I wanted to pursue.

Data can be downloaded directly from Mother Jones at the link above or [directly here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQBEbQoWMn_P81DuwmlQC0_jr2sJDzkkC0mvF6WLcM53ZYXi8RMfUlunvP1B5W0jRrJvH-wc-WGjDB1/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv)

### Additional data
While it is not included in the Mother Jones database (and a note regarding this exclusion was posted on their database page as of 2025-09-02), I have created and included in my analysis and cleaning an event for the mass shooting that took place at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis. This event is what sparked my curiosity in the analysis, and so I wanted to include it in my analysis.

### Final Data
The CSV file in this repository is the data after it has undergone all of my cleaning efforts. It is based on Mother Jones' Databaes which is open source. Data presented here is posted under the same open source availability as the original data.

## Methods
I primarily use R for cleaning and analyzing the data. I am in the process of creating an RMD file for my analysis, but have completed and will include in this repository the script I used to standardize and clean the data acquired from Mother Jones.

## Conclusions
I have not concluded my analysis yet and so there are no conclusions to share here. I will update this once that analysis is complete so that I can share my conclusions here in the README so that users of this repository do not need to delve into the files for finding those conclusions.
