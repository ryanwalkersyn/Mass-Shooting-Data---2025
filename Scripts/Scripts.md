* Mother Jones Data Cleaning.R -- the script used for cleaning the data from Mother Jones database

  _Note: this script requires the source data named as "Mother Jones - Mass Shooting Database, 1982 - 2025.csv" to work. As I am not the data owner, I have not included that data in this repository. Should you wish to replicate the cleaning process using this script, you will need to download the dataset from Mother Jones' website_
